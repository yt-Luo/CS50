sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?:
Running time of sort1 is different between running random number and running sorted number.
Bubble sort has a Big O running time of n square and a Omega running time of n.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?:
Running time of sort2 is same while running random number and running sorted number.
Running time of sort2 is less than that of sort3.
Merge sort has a theta running time of n log n.
Selection sort has a theta running time of n square.
n log n is smaller than n square.
So sort2 uses merge sort.

sort3 uses: selection sort
